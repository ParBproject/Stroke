# 🧠 Stroke Prediction Model in R

This project builds and deploys a **stroke prediction model** using R.  
The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, model evaluation, and deployment.  
The final trained model is saved and can be reused for making predictions.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset comes from [Kaggle – Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).  

It includes patient information such as:
- Gender, age, marital status, work type, residence type  
- Health factors (hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, BMI)  
- Lifestyle factors (smoking status)  
- Stroke outcome (target variable: 1 = stroke, 0 = no stroke)
